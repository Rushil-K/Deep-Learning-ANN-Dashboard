## 🚀 Features  
✔ **Train an ANN Model** with customizable hyperparameters  
✔ **Live Accuracy & Loss Graphs**  
✔ **Confusion Matrix Visualization**  
✔ **Feature Importance using RandomForest Surrogate Model**  
✔ **ROC Curve & AUC Score**  
✔ **Class Distribution Pie Chart**  
✔ **Data Distribution Analysis (Pairplot)**
