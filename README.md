### ANN Dashboard: [Live Demo](https://deep-learning-ann-dashboard-wahepxbuycny2mhlngvmch.streamlit.app/)

## 🔬 ANN Dashboard with Streamlit  

This project is an **interactive dashboard** built using **Streamlit**, designed for training and evaluating an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** on a preprocessed dataset. It includes hyperparameter tuning options and visualizations for performance analysis.

---

## 🚀 Features  
✔ **Train an ANN Model** with customizable hyperparameters  
✔ **Live Accuracy & Loss Graphs**  
✔ **Confusion Matrix Visualization**  
✔ **Feature Importance using RandomForest Surrogate Model**  
✔ **ROC Curve & AUC Score**  
✔ **Class Distribution Pie Chart**  
✔ **Data Distribution Analysis (Pairplot)**

## 📂 Dataset  
- The dataset used for training is **`nmrk2627_df_processed.csv`** (preprocessed).  
- The target variable is **"Converted"** (binary classification).

## 🖥️ Dashboard Overview  
Once running, you can:  

- Adjust **hyperparameters** (epochs, batch size, neurons, activation function, etc.)  
- Train the **ANN model** with a single click  
- View **performance metrics and visualizations**
